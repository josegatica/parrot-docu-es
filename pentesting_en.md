Pentesting or Penetration Testing
Pentesting? What is it?
Pentesting are penetration testings made to a system. likewise it is a legal and authorized attemp to successfuly find and exploit  computer systems with the purpose to make this sistem much more secure.
Importance
The penetration testings are important because you know the insecurity level of our applications, that allows to evaluate the security level of the technologoc infraestructure. Since some years it was checked that thnks to these testings they could find critical holes in the applications where the cibercriminals could get inside, damage or steal information.
When carring penetration testings of that kind, it will permite to find the vulnerability points more visibles, making easy the control implantation of security and preventive ways to avoid intrussions and behaviors do not expected in the evaluate equipment.
How could it be applied?
Although it is necessary to have experience and great knowledge to perform penetration tests, this type of testing is not exclusively for large organizations with a set of servers that provide different services and network segments of tens or hundreds of computers.
Penetration tests can be run on independent teams and even a personal team.
A penetration testcould be applied in scenarios such as web pages, mobile applications, electronic devices, computers, among others, as follows: the objective is sought, the victim or the application, a recognition is made of it, after it is scanned to see the holes, it is exploited and at the end a report is made to the owner or author of the application.
Development of a penetration test
For the development of a Penetration Testing you need to follow a methodology. It can be the following way:
- Recognition of the objective
- Scanning
- Exploitation
- Report
	- Recognition of the objective
	- Scanning
	- Exploitation
	- Report
There is a first stage independent of those mentioned above, it is of great importance and should not be omitted for any reason, at this stage the authorization is established by the applicant for the penetration tests. This action is one of those that make the difference between a pentester and a cracker.
In some methodologies as well as training courses for pentesters it is mentioned that you can not launch a simple ping if you do not have the authorization signed by the applicant, this authorization is very important since it will be the legal backing for any existing problem in the evaluation process ..
This authorization document must contain at least the following information:
- Date and time of start of the tests
- Date and time of completion of the tests
- Equipment to be evaluated, specifying IP address
- Name of the team or person who will perform the tests
- Contact details of the team or person who will perform the tests
- Name of the applicant for the tests
- Applicant signature of agreement
The pentesting has become a very common practice for both the emotional and natural persons who would like to know if their system is safe or if they have gaps that cybercriminals can enter
